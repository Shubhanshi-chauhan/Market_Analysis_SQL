## Task:

1. Calculate Total Revenue
2. Calculate Total Sales by Product
3. Find Top Customers by Revenue
 
 Let’s solve all these problems one by one for the task of Market Analysis using SQL. First, let’s create the input table for our SQL database (I am using MySql):

### Calculating total revenue:

This query calculates the total revenue earned from all the sales recorded in the “Sales” table. It does so by adding the values in the “Revenue” column. The result of this calculation is given the name “TotalRevenue” for better identification and reference.

This query retrieves information from the “Sales” table and calculates the total quantity sold and revenue generated for each product. By grouping the data based on the unique product IDs, the query calculates the sum of the quantities and revenues associated with each product. The results are presented with the respective product IDs, total quantities, and total revenues for further analysis or reporting.

### Finding top customers by revenue:

This query retrieves information from the “Sales” table and calculates the total revenue generated by each customer. By grouping the data based on the unique customer IDs, the query calculates the sum of the revenues associated with each customer. The results are then sorted in descending order based on the total revenue and limited to the top 5 rows, allowing us to identify the customers with the highest total revenues.

# Summary
So this is how we can perform Market Analysis using SQL. These were just examples of the kind of problems you will face in Market Analysis.
